  volumes:
    - name: hostpath-volume
      hostPath: 			# volume type 'hostPath'
        path: /var/jenkins_home		# Path we are defining in this definition can be local path / NFS paths.

  containers:

#-----------------------------------------------------#
# 1. Volume type 'hostPath' can be created either by using NFS / local host paths.
# 2. Exiting NFS mounts can be used as 'hostPath' volumes.
# 3. 'hostPath' volumes are NOT 'EPHEMERAL'
# 4. If Pod dies/restarts data will NOT be lost. 
# 5. Since we are using NFS(it should be mounted before creating 'hostPath' volume), if its mounted on all cluster-nodes, same data will be accessible from new Pod.
# 6. If you are using a 'hostPath' as a local path which is NOT available on worker node, it will get cretaed at the time of Pod Creation.
